# WebHL

## https://x8bitrain.github.io/webhl/

WebHL is a fork of [hlviewer.js](https://github.com/skyrim/hlviewer.js) that uses the File System Access API to load game assets direct from your computer rather than from a server.

### How to use

Click "Open Game Directory" and open either the "valve" or "cstrike" folder in your Half-Life or Counter Strike 1.6 game folder. A list of available maps and demos will open for you to choose from.

### Bugs

 - Changing maps causes texture bugs on some browsers.
 - Some sounds don't play in the right order.
